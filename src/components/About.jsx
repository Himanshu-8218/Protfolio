ðŸ’» Aspiring Data Scientist | Laravel Developer | Python & C/C++ Enthusiast<br/>

Iâ€™m a tech-driven individual with a strong foundation in software development and a keen interest in data science. During my B.Tech in IT, I gained hands-on experience in building real-world applications using Laravel, including a Gen-Ai Driven Task Management System and other dynamic web solutions. I'm also actively learning Data Science with Python, focusing on data analysis, visualization, and machine learning fundamentals.<br/>

In addition to web development, Iâ€™m comfortable with C/C++, which has helped me strengthen my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.<br/>
